                <h1>Janet Chawla's Biography</h1> 
                <img src="assets/images/janet.jpg" width="200" height="199" style="float: Left; margin-right: 7px; margin-top: 5px"> Janet Chawla, an American by birth, has lived and worked in India for 30 years. She is married to Kanwarjit Singh Chawla and is the mother of three children, and the delighted grandmother of two. 
                <br> 
                <br> Ms Chawla started her working life in India teaching natural childbirth classes to women and couples, helping them prepare for non-medicated, non-surgical birth. Her frustration with the over-use of invasive obstetrical practices led her to begin investigations of ‘indigenous’ natural childbirth, Indian pregnancy and birth traditions, and dais (traditional midwives). 
                <br> 
                <br> Ms Chawla has researched, lectured and consulted on indigenous concepts of ‘reproductive health’ nationally and internationally. She is currently Director of MATRIKA, an NGO active in research and advocacy for humane and traditional birth practice. 
                <h2> ADVOCACY AND ACTIVISM </h2> Spoke at the Dai Sammelan April 21, 2007 in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. Attended by 1500 dais, the meeting was organized by the “Dai Association of Gujarat” (mainly Chetna, Sewa Rural, Sewa Ahmendabad, and other prominent NGOs) Encouraged dais to hold on to their traditional knowledge and customs—lone voice in the calls for cleanliness and institutionalization. 
                <br> 
                <br> Presentation on Indigenous Health &amp; Healing Traditions, a panel of presentations at the 10th International Women’s Health Meeting held in Delhi, September 2005. Organized and conducted a seminar Dharti Ma, Dai Ma – indigenous birth knowledge as a cultural resource. This was an exchange of perspectives between 30 medical doctors, public health professionals, NGOs, activists and scholars and accompanied the exhibition of the same name. (November, 2004) 
                <br> 
                <br> Through Sahaj, Society for Alternatives in Health and Development, advocated ‘natural childbirth’ practices with NGO’s holding workshops in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Delhi, 1990-91. Began identifying similarities between natural childbirth and traditional Indian birth practice. 
                <h2> BRINGING BIRTH TO THE ARTS </h2> 
                <h3> Exhibition </h3> Generated and produced MATRIKA exhibition “Dharti Ma, Dai Ma: A Remix” (Earth Mother: Midwife Mother) drawing upon MATRIKA research and Indian cultural imagery of the fertility of the female body and the earth. Habitat Visual Arts Gallery, New Delhi (November 2004) Film Co-produced the film ‘Born at Home’ (Video. 60 Minutes with English Subtitles) observes indigenous birth practices in parts of North India. Poised between social reality and the eternal mystery of childbearing, the film presents an intricate portrait of the dai (midwife) who is almost always a low-caste, poor woman. The dais methods are holistic, conceiving of childbirth, not as pathology but as continuation of organic life. Gender and class issues are juxtaposed with the filming of the miracle of an actual birth. Sublunar films, Sameera Jain director. Camera: Rita Banerjee, Editing: Monica Bhasin 
                <br> 
                <br> The film has participated in the Margaret Mead festival in New York, the Mediawave film and video festival in Hungary, the Film South Asia at Kathmandu and also the Traveling Film South Asia, and in several festivals in India [MIFF, Prakriti, are among them]. It has been shown at the `Humanisation of Childbirth' conference in Brazil, and other health/academic/gender forums in the USA. 
                <br> Magic Lantern is currently distributing the film. 
                <br> 
                <h3> Play </h3> Organized, presented and acted in the play “Birth” scripted by a New York playwright and based on her interviews of women on their experiences of giving birth. The play “Birth” was performed in cities throughout the US and abroad as a part of a project BOLD--Birth On Labor Day to give expression to women’s experiences of childbirth, their joys and sufferings and thoughts on the medical handling of birth.
