                <h2> Food, Drink, Herbs and Locally Available Resources </h2> These days 
                <em>Dais</em> use a new blade to cut the cord, earlier they used an iron knife heated over fine.” –Bihar 
                <br> 
                <br> “Some examples of hot food and drink are a fine paste of garlic, curry leaves and mustard seeds with rice (Andhra Pradesh), a spoonful of 
                <em>ajwain</em> daily helps food digestion or milk with 
                <em>ghee</em>, 
                <em>ahwain</em> and jaggery." –Delhi 
                <br> 
                <br> “Sweet pudding (
                <em>Gur ka seera, dalia</em>) is given after childbirth. If she desires, roti is given.” –Rajasthan 
                <br> 
                <br> “We give food after birth as this gives energy to the new mother, she will have milk for the baby and will also not have stomach ache.” –Manohari, Rajasthan 
                <br> 
                <br> “Sweet pudding is the first thing given to eat. Then warm drink of milk and ghee. Woman is given sweet balls made out of edible gum (
                <em>gondh ki laddu</em>). Spces or chilli are not given, nor is she allowed to have cold food." – Manori, Rajasthan 
                <br> 
                <br> “We make the baby lick the blood of placenta. This keeps the baby from respiratory problem." –Mohini, Rajasthan 
                <br> 
                <br> “Some women get the desired to eat mud after delivery. This urge may be because of lack of blood. We advised them to have roasted black gram, lentils or nuts.” – Punjab 
                <br> 
                <br> “For the forty days, we tell the new mother to drink warm water.” –Punjab 
                <br> 
                <br> “After delivery a woman is not given any grain or heavy food. This is called 
                <em>narak</em> fasting (
                <em>Narak</em> 
                <em>Upwas</em> or fasting during the time of 
                <em>Narak</em>). Grain is only given on the third day after all the dirty blood comes out. On the first day, she eats biscuits with tea. She drinks warm water. Second day, heat-producing balls mage out of ginger, pepper, turmeric, roasted rice, milk, jaggery (
                <em>saunth</em> balls). Third day, rice, lentil soup and vegetables are given. Rice is not given immediately after birth. First, we massage her. This relaxes her muscles, only after this she can digest her food. Turmeric lessens pain, dries the 
                <em>shareer</em> and the 
                <em>saunth</em> helps in forming milk.” –Pairia Devi, Bihar 
                <br> 
                <br> “We give warm fomentation to woman’s vagina. Also warm pieces of brick are kept in an earthen pot and placed on her belly. By this the bad blood melts and comes out.” –Rani, Delhi 
                <br> 
                <br> “When a 
                <em>jachcha</em> gets 
                <em>gola</em> pain (postpartum pain, the involution of the uterus) a coconut is broken near the head of the
                <em> jachcha’s</em> bed. A few pieces are given to jachcha to eat and the rest is distributed.” –Praveen, Delhi 
                <br> 
                <br> “The Dai massages the new mother for six days, foments her belly with arandi leaves and tie her waist with cloth. She feeds the woman and gives her hot brew of ajwain.” –Bihar 
                <br> 
                <br> “A paste of turmeric, 
                <em>ajwain</em> and neem leaves is used to massage her. Her shareer is fumigated with Onion bhusi, garlic bhusi, loban and hair, these four are burnt. She squats over this. This helps in healing her 
                <em>shareer</em> and helps get rid of the bad blood.” -Dhapo, Delhi 
                <br> 
                <br> “The roots of wild berries bush (
                <em>baer</em>) is pounded and boiled. 
                <em>Jachcha</em> is made to sit in water. This helps contracting and cleaning the womb.” –Dhapo, Delhi 
                <br> 
                <br> “Before we used to make the women lie on sand (
                <em>dhool</em>-
                <em>mitti</em>) to deliver. If the woman felt cold, then I used to heat up the sand. Now, we are given plastic sheets by Urmul. So we spread these sheets during birth.” –Manohari, Rajasthan

                <h2> Skills and Knowledge </h2> “If the baby is doing fine then we clean baby’s mouth with cotton or cloth and place next to mother. By this mother and child feel secure and warm.” –Punjab 
                <img src="assets/images/herbal.jpg" width="300" height="211" class="floatRight"> “The Dai massages 
                <em>jachcha</em> from stomach to pelvic area, to facilitate placenta delivery.” –Delhi 
                <br> 
                <br> “She may put a hair in 
                <em>jachcha’s</em> mouth to make her gag. This reflex action expels the placenta. Or an ash drink may be given to her.” –Delhi 
                <br> 
                <br> “To expel the placenta, the Dai massages the belly, and may get the woman to gag putting the new mother’s hair in her mouth.” –Bihar 
                <br> 
                <br> “There are also ways to help placenta to come out. We press the belly and massage it in circles. This it comes out.” –Tara, Delhi 
                <br> 
                <br> “After birth, if the placenta doesn’t come straight out in the passage, it gets stuck in the empty womb and takes time comes. Then we make the women cough.” –Guddi, Rajasthan 
                <br> 
                <br> “After birth of the baby, the 
                <em>Dai</em> presses the stomach from above. This prevents the placenta from moving up.” –Bihar 
                <br> 
                <br> “We cut the chord only after the placenta is delivered and after the baby has cried. If cord is cut before placenta is out, it is dangerous because the placenta may go up.” –Bihar 
                <br> 
                <br> “Placenta is poisonous for the woman if it stays in her body. If it goes up in the belly the woman can die.” –Punjab 
                <br> 
                <br> “I consider cutting the cord a sin equal to killing of a 100 cows. I have delivered many babies but have cut only 12 cords – of my own 12 children. I always make the jachcha cut her own cord.” -Dhapo, Delhi 
                <br> 
                <br> “It is my job to cut the cord. However, I do not cut cord of babies whoa re related to me. They are my own blood. The cords of these babies are like my roots, so how can I cut my own root? I handle their births but someone else cuts the cord.” –Satwant Kaur, Punjab 
                <br> 
                <br> “When a Dai cuts the cord, she offers something to the Gods.” –Delhi

The baby may be given lick of honey or jaggery, or may be placed at the breast immediately. Dais are from various communities (Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh), and so are their clients. Often the Dai is from the same community, but not always.

                <br> “Both mother and baby are massaged.

                <br> “
                <em>Gola</em> is the protector of the baby. When the baby comes out it looks around for the baby. Therefore there is pain. When it doesn’t find the baby it settles down on its own.” –Praveen, Delhi

                <br> “We tie the belly and press the 
                <em>gola</em>. This is more difficult then handling a delivery. If there is lot of pain then hot fomentation of gola is done. We place a warm metal pot containing pieces of warm bricks on the abdomen.” –Rajasthan 
                <br>
