                    <li class="default">Talking about the body in terms of sexuality and fertility is tabooed. In the village group meetings organised by MJK (Mahila Jagriti Kendra) and MS (Mahila Samakhya) sahayoginis, village women have said -- "You talk like prostitutes!" Village women have also said that if their men knew that there is all this talk (about reproduction and childbirth), they would not allow them to attend these meetings. </li> 
                    <li class="default">During the session on Body Mapping, there were inhibitions, and a lot of laughter when the local term for vagina (<em>burr</em>) was mentioned. </li> 
                    <li class="default"><em>Kuan puja</em> (well worship) takes place generally on the third day after childbirth. The <i>dai</i> (also called <em>maharain</em>) massages the new mother with oil. She puts <em>sindwar </em>leaves in water and boils them, bathes baby with this water. She presses a thread under the tongue so the baby's voice is loud and clear, and presses the baby's lips and eyebrows. Saas and <em>nanad </em>clean the room, nanad is given <em>neg</em>. After bath, the new mother touches the feet of elders and ancestors. </li> 
                    <li class="default">From childbirth up to <i>chhati</i> (usually on 6th day after birth, could be 5 or 7 or 9 days) the new mother and new-born baby are believed to be in `narak Kurd'' (literally, `vessel of hell'; it is a period of pollution). From birth upped <i>chhati</i>, the woman is not to touch anything else in the house. The <i>dai</i> is her companion during these days. The new mother and baby are in a separate room -- wherein the birth too had taken place -- and she is given food there itself, on a leaf-plate. She is to do no housework. It is only after <i>chhati</i> ceremonies are performed that the mother and child, and <i>dai</i>, and in fact whole family, are redeemed from a state of pollution. </li> 
                    <li> <strong><span class="default"><i>Chhati</i> </span></strong><span class="default"> day marks the closure of the period of `<em>narak Kurd</em>'. On <i>chhati</i>, the <i>dai</i> checks to see if the cord has fallen; bathes the baby; beats a <em>Thai </em>(metal plate). The mother is bathed, both mother and baby wear new clothes. The <i>dai</i> hands over the baby to the <em>devarani </em>(the mother's younger sister-in-law), who does <em>namaskar </em>(respectful salutation by folding hands) and then hands the baby to the <em>jethani</em> (elder sister-in-law). The <i>dai</i> cleans the room, and she bathes. </span>

                      <li class="default">Before <i>chhati</i>, <em>sasural</em> (marital home) people visit the maika (natal home) people, and invite them by offering lota for `<em>samadhi milan</em>'''. The maika people come at <i>chhati</i> and are welcomed. When the maika people arrive, first a curtain is put between the two sets of parents (of the new-born's mother, and the new-born's father), the <em>sasural </em>people sprinkle water on the <em>maika </em>people, both sides give paan (betel leaves) to one another, feet are washed, beard shaved, and the <em>samadhis</em> (parents of the young couple, from both sides) embrace each other. There is <i>chhati</i> <em>bharna</em> -- the woman's mother (baby's <em>nani</em>) gives oil and new clothes for the new-born. She lights a <em>diya</em>, rice is kept in a plate, and arti is performed for the baby. Five children are fed <em>kheer</em>. The woman's mother also brings new clothes for her son-in-law and others. The woman herself (i.e. the new-born's mother) is adorned with <em>sindur</em> and <em>kajal</em>. Special foods are cooked. From this day, she can eat everything. The entire family, and <i>dai</i> eat together on <i>chhati</i> day. If the baby is a boy, food and books are kept for him; if it is a girl, utensils are kept. The <i>dai</i> takes leave the next day. The <em>saas</em> puts <em>sindur</em> and<em> kajal </em>for her, and gives her a new sari, rice, sometimes money. The <i>dai</i> should leave happy. It is believed that if the <i>dai</i> is happy, the baby too will be happy. </li> 
                     </ol> </li> 
                    <li> <span class="default">The <i>dais</i> seem to share a wide cultural understanding in which the upper part of the body is associated with `<em>swarg</em>'' (heaven) and also with the upper castes; the middle part of the body is associated with `<em>dharti'</em> (earth) and also with the middle castes; and the lower part of the body is associated with `<em>narak'</em> (hell) and also with the lower castes. The genital area is included in the lower part of the body. One <i>dai</i> questioned this arrangement, by asking, during the workshop, "The whole body is one, then why is there this division, with one part considered untouchable?" [The corollary was also implied in her question, i.e. if all of society is one, then why is there this division, with one part of society considered untouchable?] </span>

                      <li class="default">The <i>dais</i> also commented that before puberty girls are considered to be holy, but not so after puberty. After birth also, a woman is considered to be polluted and unholy. </li>

                   <ol type="a"> 
                    <li class="default">The compounder (CB Sharma) when interviewed said he has done a diploma in pharmacy, and works in his brother-in-law's chemist shop in Gomia. He goes to homes and administers injections if prescribed by a doctor (to whom a <i>dai</i> may have referred a case). For injections he uses disposable syringes. Each compounder has a prescribed area. Sometimes the <i>dai</i> may come directly to him to ask for pitocin or oxytocin injections if there is dilatation without labour pains: then too he goes and administers an injection; sometimes he puts a drip too. An injection is needed in 2% of cases, while 95% are normal deliveries; 2% deliveries are conducted by private doctors and 1% taken to the hospital in Hazaribagh. CB Sharma considers the rituals practiced by people, by <i>dais</i>, and by <i>ojhas </i> or <i>majhis</i> to be useless and a waste of money. He says that after administering pitocin birth takes place within 5 or 7 minutes; but in case the first dose is not effective then after 3 hours a second dose is given. At times the compounder may refer a <i>dai</i> to Dr. Madhuri or Dr. Horo (private practitioners in Gomia). He says that people do not on the whole like to take injections. He is critical of <i>dais</i>’ work because he says women can get infected; but sees it as necessary because not everybody can go to doctors. </li> 
                    <li class="default">Sr. Mary, of the MJK Mission Hospital, notes that the private doctors do not accept poor patients; they charge 600-700 per normal delivery. The compounder CB Sharma said that "Poor people are dying as your hospital is not taking delivery cases." </li> 
                    <li class="default">There are now 16 chemists shops in Gomia, although (according to the Compounder) there is not much increase in sale. Increase in the number of shops is more a consequence of unemployment. </li> 
                    <li class="default">[<i>dais</i> seem to have accepted the medical model, most have contact with doctors and ANMs. But it is a question how far they are able to procure appropriate medical interventions. Doctors and other health professionals seem to have a biased approach, they think the <i>dais</i>’ methods are wrong, without examination.] </li> 
                   </ol> 
                  </div> </li> 
                 <li> 
                  <div align="justify"> 
                   <span class="lrgtxt2">Identity and Status of<i>dais</i></span> 
                   <ol type="a"> 
                    <li class="default">The <i>dais</i> of Gomia come across as situated at the lower end of various power-arrangements -- in terms of caste, class as well as gender. </li> 
                    <li class="default">In terms of <strong>caste</strong>, the <i>dais</i> are all `<em>Chamar</em>'' (or <em>Ravidas</em>). Being a polluted caste, associations of pollution with the work of midwifery get integrated into the overall understanding of <i>dais</i> as untouchable. </li> 
                    <li class="default">A <strong>caste-class</strong> nexus is at work here. In Gomia, a feudal <em>jajmani</em> (patron-client) system is in operation. </li> 
                    <li class="default">Over the past 3 or 4 months, one <i>dai</i>, <em>Razia</em>, had performed 10 deliveries in the homes of kisans (literally, farmers -- landed middle-caste -- her jajmans or patrons). Another <i>dai</i> Phoolkumari had conducted 2 deliveries in the homes of gawalas (owners of milch cattle -- middle caste). </li> 
                    <li class="default">The <i>dai</i> shares a low status alongwith other women, be they high-caste or low-caste. However, through a game on <strong>gender</strong>, we found that approximately half the participants would prefer to be a man in their next birth. The reasons why they would prefer mailed indicate the down-side of their experience of being women -- one said if she is a boy, she can play, have fun and relax at home; others said women have to work too hard and moreover they are taken for granted; oner said that she is tired of this life; the reason given by another was that her husband had left her so in her next birth she would leave someone -- men can keep more than one wife; one participant expressed that as a man "I will be able to earn, will not get `married off' [i.e. go at a young age into a new, marital, household], and I will have a wife to press my feet!"; another commented that women have many health problems, and are not cared for by anyone." </li> 
                    <li class="default">However, approximately half the participants said they would like to be reborn as females. The reasons given indicate, partly, a certain pride in themselves<em> as women</em>. One said she would like to be a woman in her next birth too because "a woman makes a home, and ensures survival of the world"; another said the world is perpetuated by women, and if women have problems, so do men; another said she would like to do something for the next generation of girls. Others said -- they would prefer being reborn as women simply because that is what they are right now; they will continue to have many problems which they will attempt to solve; they would work on the land.... </li> 
                    <li class="default">Of course, <i>dais</i> are repositories of certain quintessentially female knowledge -- the knowledge of the female body, and of childbirth. Thus, they partake in a very special way of both the down-side and the up-side of the general status of women. <i>dais</i> are women who know about womanhood -- about femaleness -- in a more special way than do other women. In other words, <i>dais</i> in a unique way embody in themselves both the<em> pollution and the power</em> that attaches to womanhood. </li> 
                    <li class="default"><i>dais</i> are highly respected at the time of birth, but at the same time it is a period of untouchability so they, being caste-untouchables, can be the companions of the mother, who, by nature of her birth-giving, is in a state of <em>pollution</em>. Therefore the <i>dai</i>'s status is full of contradictions. At <i>chhati</i>, the <i>dai</i> is traditionally honoured by the family in which the baby has been born. They put sindur on her, give her gifts and money. They want her to be happy, and believe that the baby will be happy if the <i>dai</i> is happy. </li> 
                    <li class="default"><i>dais</i> customarily do not assist in the deliveries of their own daughter-in-law. It is done by gotni or <em>devarani</em>, or a neighbouring <i>dai</i>. Sometimes, rather than call in a neighbouring <i>dai</i> which will mean an expense, the mother-in-law may do it herself. But it is considered a matter of <em>sharam</em>. </li>

                   <ol type="a"> 
                    <li class="default">Located in S. Bihar, Ranchi and Dhanbad being the adjacent towns, Gomia is in the coal mining belt. Only 1/4th of the total land area is cultivable. Agriculture and coal are the major sources of livelihood for the original inhabitants of the area. Employment in the Indian Explosives Limited is largely restricted to people who have migrated here. The original inhabitants of the area, which was earlier forested, were Santhali tribals. They got displaced when forests were cut, fields carved out and factories and mines set up. Staple crops in the area are rice and corn. </li> 
                    <li class="default">Most land is owned now by <em>Yadavs, Telis and Kumhars</em>, while <em>Santhalis</em> work as agricultural labourers, constructions workers and petty coal business like selling small quantities of coal (usually illegally). Santhalis keep goats, hens and pigs too; and brew rice beer. Oraons are more educated than Santhalis, most have adopted Christianity and are economically better off. Non-tribals include outcastes like Dushadh, Chamar, Ravidas; other caste groups are<em> Baniya</em>, <em>Teli, Yadav, Kumhar, Lohar</em> etc. </li> 
                    <li class="default">The jajmani system is prevalent, with the upper castes acting as patrons of the lower castes in a complex network of duties and obligations. The lower caste provide services (including that of midwifery) to the upper castes, for which they are paid in various forms, on various occasions. The clients are fixed, neither side can change allegiance. It is not a free market situation. A particular <i>dai</i> will be associated with a particular family of `<em>Kisans</em>' (here, a generic term for the middle and upper castes i.e. the <em>jajmans</em>). This is an obligatory relationship. In the jajmani system, there is security of work and no conflict or competition as in a market. </li> 
                    <li class="default">Overall there is a mixed economy. Market economy and market values are entering the area, and men are more prone to break away from the <em>jajmani</em> bonds. But women are by and large ensconced within these bonds, and have also in fact taken over some labour that was traditionally men's, in agriculture. Income from<em> jajmani </em>work is insufficient and families look for additional work in the market. Agricultural work is available for only two months in a year, they are paid 1.5 kg <i>dai</i>ly (i.e. Rs. 15-16). Construction work may fetch Rs 25-30 <i>dai</i>ly, and coal-selling up to Rs 50-100 per day. </li> 
                    <li class="default">A number of illegal systems are in operation and have become a normal way of life; these include -- illegal coal business; illegal liquor refineries; illegal prostitution; illegal medical practices such as compounders injecting oxytocin. Lots of middle-men have emerged, including petty contractors who act as a link between coal sellers, policemen and coal mafia; and compounders, who act as a link between <i>dais</i>, doctors and ANMs. </li> 
                    <li class="default">Women bear the burden of household tasks (including fetching water from long distances, in a situation of acute water shortage), as well as earning a living. Men as well as women who go to the town or city to work have to walk long distances from the villages -- as much as 8 to 10 kms one way. Buses seem an unnecessary expense, they charge 3-4 Rs. </li> 
                    <li class="default">Eating habits have changed, with less green leafy vegetables and fruits like <em>mahua</em>, and more items bought from the (weekly) market such as brinjals, tomatos, ladies finger, white peas and <em>besan</em>. </li> 
                    <li class="default">Standard of education is low, hardly anybody studies beyond middle school. Girls study less than boys. Mission schools are preferred to government schools. </li> 
                    <li class="default">Dowry is a problem. Educated boys ask for 20-25,000 Rs as dowry, and lots is spent on pomp and show. Bigamy is still prevalent. Violence against women -- wife-beating -- is a big problem in the colonies. It is worse in families where men are employed in CCL or IEL -- have secure jobs. A number of men have abandoned their wives. </li> 
                    <li class="default">Festivals are celebrated round the year. `<em>Karma</em>'' is a major festival, it is for brother-sister unit, and the `<em>Karam</em>' tree is worshipped, and women sing and dance. `<em>Jitya</em>' is a festival for the well-being of sons; and `<em>Teej'</em> for husbands. Women fast on these days. </li> 
                    <li class="default">Birth and death rituals differ for tribals and non-tribals.</li> 
                    <li class="default">Tribals and non-tribals do not intermix much. <em>Santhalis</em> are apprehensive about outsiders, and retain strong faith in traditional healers. </li> 
                    <li class="default"><strong>Khamra Basti</strong> is located near Gomia town, most men from here work in CCL (Central Coalfields Ltd) and IEL. Some women are <i>dais</i>, some agricultural labourers. It is a Harijan basti with pace houses. We saw some young men playing cards, women said they are unemployed and therefore loiter around. Local alcohol is brewed from mahua. Men from town come and drink, and also there is prostitution. </li> 
                    <li class="default"><strong>Karmatiya</strong> is near a colliery and almost everyone earns by selling coal. It is 12 km from Gomia town, roads are in bad shape. The inhabitants buy coal illegally from the colliery, carry it home, sell it to contractors at godowns or local consumers. There are a large number of <i>dais</i>. In all there are about 100 <em>kacha</em> houses, they are big and open, with pits in separate pig-houses. Here too there are water problems. The government has cut down local forests and have planted protected forests, there is no land left even for use as toilets. Most people have moved out to Khamra <em>basti</em> and the people are afraid the area may be declared a coal mine area and they may all be displaced. </li> 
                    <li class="default"><strong>Bela Tand village</strong> -- Land adjoining this village belongs to <em>Yadavs</em>, some to <em>Dushadhs</em>. The <em>Dushadhs</em> work as <i>dais</i> and agricultural labourers. Men too work as agricultural labour and go for construction work. <i>dais</i>' jajmans stay far off. </li>

                    <li class="default">MJK and MS workers are called <em>sahayoginis</em>. They are a core resource group. Each sahayogini holds weekly meetings in 10 fixed villages. She shares information with the village women about training programmes, does surveys on women's health, runs savings accounts, and supervises the educational centres. The <em>sahayoginis</em> have a deep relationship with the women. </li> 
                    <li class="default">There is no clear division between MJK and MS, but source of funds and payment are different. The disparity in salary does not seem to be a source of conflict. On the whole there is dissatisfaction with salaries, they are on the low side. This is a reason for some tension in the organisation. </li> 
                    <li class="default"><em>Sahayoginis </em>are extremely hard-working, and diligent. Each bears a lot of responsibilities. The work is directed by Pilar. The workers are well informed about their basic work i.e. violence against women. </li> 
                    <li class="default">They are busy in their routine work and do not get much time to follow up workshops like this one. </li> 
                    <li class="default">After this workshop <em>sahayoginis</em> said it would be good if they learnt birthing work. They developed a critique of the routinised medical practice of giving injections and episiotomies. Some said they would like to learn from <i>dais</i>, and assist them in childbirth. The <i>dais</i> would not like to share their jajmani work, but may want to give over work in poor houses. </li> 
                    <li class="default"><em>Sahayoginis</em> will share the knowledge that food should be given to a woman after delivery (jaggery, black grams, chura, and tonics of <em>mahua</em>, <em>anwala</em>, <em>berries</em> etc). </li> 
                    <li class="default"><em>Sahayoginis</em> will do some field research on maternal death. </li>
